    <br><h2>Welcome to my website!</h2><br>
    The purpose of this website is for my personal project. This website is mainly for teen girls who are underweight and want to start their own fitness journey towards weight gain. I will share some of my advice, tips, resources, etc.<br><br>
      
      <br><h4 id="bold">Is being underweight an actual problem?</h4><br>Being underweight leaves you feeling tired easily and lowers your energy. This also affects your immune system, making it easier for you to pick up on colds, infections, etc. It affects how your hormones function, delaying your period at times. To add on, you might be missing essential minerals and vitamins such as iron and clacium. This could then lead to osteoporosis. These are just a few of the potiental problems of being underweight. <br><br><br>
